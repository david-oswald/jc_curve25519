### Usage

*Beware: [until v0.5 is released](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro/milestones), both command line and Java API are subject to change without notice. Check back often.*

#### Warning about correct keying

Command line samples assume default test keys of ```40..4F```. If you need custom keys, specify them with any or all of the following options: ```-keyid``` ```-keyver``` and ```-enc``` ```-mac``` ```-kek``` or ```-key``` (for a single master key). You need to know the details or ask your card provider. Some cards require key diversification with ```-emv``` or ```-visa2``` (you should be notified if that's the case).

#### Generic information

 * Show some basic information about a card (failsafe):

        java -jar gp.jar -info
        
   * On Windows just replace ```java -jar gp.jar``` with ```gp.exe``` like this:

            gp.exe -info

   * On Linux it is easier to add an alias to the shell like this:

            alias gp="java -jar $PWD/gp.jar"
            # Now you can avoid typing java -jar and gp works from any folder
            gp -h

#### List / install / delete applets

 * List applets (this and following commands open the secure channel and thus can brick your card with wrong keys!):

        gp -list # or gp -l

   How to interpret the output:
    * All AID-s of on-card objects are listed, starting with Issuer Security Domain (`ISD`)
    * Object's type, lifecycle state and privileges are listed below the `AID` line
    * Applications have type `App` and a state (like `SELECTABLE`) and privileges (like `Default selected`)
    * Executable Modules (type `ExM`, representing Java packages) are listed together with applets in them (which can be initiated with `--create`)
    * Security Domains have type `SeD`

 * Delete current default applet's package and all instances:

        gp -delete -default -deletedeps

 * Delete package ```D27600012401``` and all applets from it (`-deletedeps` can only be used with packages):

        gp -delete D27600012401 -deletedeps

 * Install `applet.cap` as default applet (with AID information from the CAP):

        gp -install applet.cap -default

 * Install `applet.cap` (with AID information from the CAP):

        gp -install applet.cap

 * Unistall `applet.cap` (with AID information from the CAP):

        gp -uninstall applet.cap

 * Create new instance of applet `D2760001240102000000000000000000` from package `D27600012401` with AID `D2760001240102000000000272950000`:

        gp -package D27600012401 -applet D2760001240102000000000000000000 -create D2760001240102000000000272950000

 * Same as previous, but takes the package/applet AID-s from CAP file and makes the new instance default selected:

        gp -cap OpenPGPApplet.cap -create D2760001240102000000000272950000 -default

##### Installation options
 * `-default` - makes the applet default selected
 * `-terminate` - gives card lock and card terminate privileges to the applet
 * `-sdomain` - specifies security domain privilege
 * `-params <hex>` - installation parameters for applet

#### Lock / unlock usage

 * Set ```010B0371D78377B801F2D62AFC671D95``` key to a card with default ```40..4F``` keys:

        gp -lock 010B0371D78377B801F2D62AFC671D95

 * Set default ```40..4F``` keys to card that was previously locked with key ```010B0371D78377B801F2D62AFC671D95```:

        gp -key 010B0371D78377B801F2D62AFC671D95 -unlock
 
 * Set the default ```40..4F``` keys to a card that uses EMV diversification (like G&D):

        gp -emv -unlock
 
    \* note that you will have to use ```--relax``` option after this operation to get rid of the warning about probably needed diversification, which is not true any more.

 * Set the default ```40..4F``` keys to a card that uses VISA2 diversification with the well-known mother key on a Gemalto card:

        gp -visa2 -key 47454D5850524553534F53414D504C45 -unlock -mode clr

#### Debugging options

 * Show APDU-s sent to the card:
   
   add ```-debug``` or ```-d``` to your command

 * Be more verbose about decisions and conditions:
   
   add ```-verbose``` or ```-v``` to your command

 * Don't use MAC on commands (plain GlobalPlatform syntax):

   add ```-mode clr``` to your command (not supported on all cards)

 * Show all options recognized by ```gp``` utility:

   add ```-help``` or ```-h``` or ```--help``` to your ```gp``` command

### Usage from Java
 * For now consult the [command line utility source code](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro/blob/master/src/pro/javacard/gp/GPTool.java)
 * Rudimentary [Javadoc](http://martinpaljak.github.io/GlobalPlatformPro/)
 * General rules:
   * Expect ```RuntimeException```-s when things go unexpectedly wrong
   * ```CardException```-s when link layer fails
   * ```GPException```-s when protocol layer fails

### Supported cards
 * **NEW!** [JavaCard Buyer's Guide of 2015](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro/tree/master/docs/JavaCardBuyersGuide)
 * See [TestedCards](https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro/tree/master/docs/TestedCards)
 * Generally speaking any modern JavaCard that speaks GlobalPlatform 2.1.1+
 * Available cards from all major vendors have been tested for basic compatibility: [Athena](http://www.athena-scs.com/), [Gemalto](http://www.gemalto.com/), [Giesecke & Devrient](http://www.gi-de.com/), [Infineon](http://www.infineon.com/), [NXP (JCOP)](http://www.nxp.com/), [Oberthur](http://www.oberthur.com/)
   * If you are a smart card vendor please do *[get in touch](#contact)* for clarification and better support!

### History

The ancestor of this code is GPJ (Global Platform for SmartCardIO) which is (still) available from http://gpj.sourceforge.net. I started the project because I felt that messing with cryptic script files was not nice and I wanted to have a simple, open source, usable and native-to-the-rest-of-development-environment (Java) toolchain.

## About OpenKMS
The promise of OpenKMS is similar<sup>*</sup> to OpenSSL: 
    
> Why buy a smart card **software kit as a black box** when you can get an **open one for free**?

In regard to GlobalPlatform, the goal is to make simple operations like installing and removing applets and locking the card with new keys as easy as next-next-done - you don't have to know the whole Global Platform specification by heart for that or buy a piece of proprietary software for a few hundred euros! For all those features that are not described in the GlobalPlatform specification that actually make your card work... you still have to use those proprietary commands, but OpenKMS GlobalPlatformPro toolkit's flexibility (and its license) should allow you to do that as well.

\* <sub>With the difference that OpenKMS thrives for a easily usable and pleasantly readable, auditable and secure codebase. And yes, you have probably already sold your soul to the devil...</sub>
